# Web Pages

This web app has two pages:

* The first page shows to the users the list of tasks and they are also prompted to type a new task. On the top of the first page, the user is prompted to type the new task, and below that there is a button to submit it. When the users click on that the task is recorded and saved in the database. There are some columns that users can not see but they also are recorded such as the time they submit it and a boolean value if the task is complete or not.

* The second part of the web app has a list of tasks. There are some columns on this list. The first column has the task to do, the second column has the date-time when the users created or when the task has been modified, then the third, fourth, and fifth columns have buttons such as update, delete and complete a task. When users click on the update button, they are sent to another web page, which I will describe here later. Th delete button, delete the task from the list, and delete the record of the database. The complete button strikes the task text and also turns the text color to red. 

* The second page is the update page. On this page, the user will see the task they want to change and they can type or make changes in the input form. Then the users do click in submit and the change will be saved and shown in the list.
