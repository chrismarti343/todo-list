# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This web project is make it to record a list of things we need to do every day. When the user run the server, the first page they will see is the list of task the user have record and saved in the database. On the top, there is a input form so the user type the task and then user can click on submit to record it and save in the database. The task will be show down the form as a list. 

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

The propuse of this project is to work on my abilities coding a web page in Django. Also, this project is helpful on my daily life since I can use it to keep track of the things I need to do every day. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}

This web app has two pages:
The first page shows the users the list of task and they are also propmt to type a new task. On the top of the first page the users is prompted to type the new task and below that there is a button to summit. When the users click on that the task is recorded and save in the database. There are some collums that users can not see but they also are recorded such as: the time they submit it and a boolean value if the task is complete or not.

The second part of the web app has a list af task. There are some columns on this list. The first column has the task to do, the second column has the date time when the users created or when the task has been modified, then the third, fourth and fifth colum have button such as: update, delete and complete task. When users clicl on update button, they are sent to another web page, which I will describe it here later.
